# Reverse Linked List

## [ AlgoMonster Lesson ](https://algo.monster/liteproblems/206)

## [ Leet code link ](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/)

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

### Example 1:

![Reverse Linked List Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

### Example 2:

![Reverse Linked List Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)

Input: head = [1,2]

Output: [2,1]

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
